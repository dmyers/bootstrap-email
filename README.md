# Bootstrap Email

This project is a fork of MailGun's transactional email templates to provide a more Bootstrap like naming conventions and modular structure with Less for extensibility with variables as well as set the beginning of an email framework to allow for email clients compatabililty to start allowing anyone to deliver rich emails just like Bootstrap did for the web. If you've used Boostrap for your sites, you'll be able to setup a custome email template in no time at all.
